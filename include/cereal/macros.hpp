/*! \file macros.hpp
    \brief Preprocessor macros that can customise the cereal library

    By default, cereal looks for serialization functions with very
    specific names, that is: serialize, load, save, load_minimal,
    or save_minimal.

    This file allows an advanced user to change these names to conform
    to some other style or preference.  This is implemented using
    preprocessor macros.

    As a result of this, in internal cereal code you will see macros
    used for these function names.  In user code, you should name
    the functions like you normally would and not use the macros
    to improve readability.
